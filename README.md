# my_audio
This project is a web server API built with Express that allows users to upload and store audio files, as well as retrieve and analyze metadata for those audio files.
Users can upload audio files to the server, and the API will store them using NeDB. The API also allows users to retrieve and analyze metadata for the stored audio files, such as the duration and file size. The API also accepts query parameters that allow users to filter the audio files they want to retrieve.
In addition to the core functionality described above, the API also includes a simple browser UI interface built with Vue.js that allows users to interact with the API and view the uploaded audio files.
